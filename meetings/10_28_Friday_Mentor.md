Meeeting notes:

- had a meeting on Friday with Dr. Brede, where we discussed our ideas
- first one was about the nutrition, daily needs, recipes, favorite food, etc
- his comments were that is sounds interesting, unique (however we found out there are apps that do this), but technicaly complex
- other idea was the relation about food and health, and various other criteria
- he suggested that one is better and easier to implement, but we have to find a niche and a specific question that would be answered
- we settled about the second idea, had a discussion and agreed to meet next Monday
