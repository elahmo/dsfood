Meeting conclusions

 - or historical data for family spendings (both are better, but either will do fine) @ggtio
 - *and we definitely* need the sugar prices, 10 last years hopefully @elahmo
- cleaning of the data that is found and of the previous datasets (spendings @ggtio and sugar @elahmo)
- get access to VM, set up mongo @distropia
