Notes from meeting with Markus:
- more cases of obesity, more data in the past, there is a delay between consumption and cases of obesity
- as much as in the past as possible
- aggegated consumption that matters
- global trends, project it to regional level
- demographic data about the regions
- regression model, predict it from other sources - linear, or some other generalised model
- projection on regional level for example
- trends and consumptions on regional level, make big regression model
- regional level might have an issue with obesity, correct 
- consumption data, regional level, trends for each level
- food intake and obesity, then make the trends apply to 
- growth? too few points, aggegate consumption over lifetime


- presentation, other factors regarding consumption
- check out temporal studies, and check consumption studies, certain sugars are more dangerous


- is sugar really responsible for obesity?
- do people change consumption habbits?

- emphasise on idea
- meeting in January


Future plan
- find more data: @chidi and @gg
 - regional data about consumption
 - historical trends for global scale, as much in the past as possible
 - find longer historical data about obesity, either on global scale or local
 - check out some papers that refer datasets about sugar, obesity
 - demographics data about regions (age breakdown per regions)

- improve map/presentation @elahmo
- build models, analysis, relationship between data @lingga and @ada
